Steps 1:
 File --> New --> Project --> Web --> ASP.NET Core Web Application

Steps 2:

When the White Window Pops up , select "WEB API"

Step 3:
Go to controllers. You will find a controller already there ('ValuesController').
	- To add another controller , simply add the a new item, and Select "Web Api Controller" , give it a name.
	NB: Controllers hold the methods that get called. 

P.S. Look at the methods that are there already to get an idea of how to create and use the API Controller Methods.

8. Go to your web browser, and type in the URL section: <hostname>/api/<ControllerName> e.g. flourishAPI/api/Values
	- This should return the values from the 'Get' method from your the Values Controller. 


P.S. You can use POSTMAN to test request to the API e.g. POST and GET

NB: EVREYTIME YOU ADD NEW CODE TO THE WEP API solution/project, you need to PUBLISH THE WEB API/Site AGAIN
	- Do  this by first stopping the Website in IIS.
	- Then Go to the Project Icon in your Soltion Explorer in VS, Right Click on it click Publish, and Click Publish Again.
		- If an error is thrown after the first time you click publish, Just Publish it again, it happens sometimes.
	- Then Go back to IIS, Start the Site again, Refresh the Server. And everything should be working fine again, with your changes 
	included, e.g. your add controller.
